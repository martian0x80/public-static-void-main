**About DesiGig**

DesiGig is a digital platform that empowers informal laborers in India by connecting them with job opportunities, skill development programs, and a supportive community. It leverages technology to bridge the gap between informal laborers and employers, promoting fair wages, decent work conditions, and improved livelihoods.

**Technology Stack**

* **Frontend:** React
* **Backend:** Django REST Framework
* **Development Tools:** Node.js, npm, Python 3.x, pip

**Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/martian0x80/desigig.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd desigig
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```

4. **Install backend dependencies (adjust for required modules):**

   ```bash
   cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Development Environment**

1. **Start the React development server:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm start
   ```

   This will typically run the frontend application at http://localhost:3000 by default.

2. **Run the Django development server:**

   ```bash
   cd backend && python manage.py runserver
   ```

   This will expose the backend API at http://localhost:8000 by default.

**Contributing**

We welcome contributions from the community! Please see the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines on how to contribute code, report issues, and propose changes.

**Additional Considerations**

* **Environment variables:** You might want to create a separate file to manage sensitive environment variables (e.g., database credentials) and reference them appropriately in both your frontend and backend code.
* **Database configuration:** The `requirements.txt` file might need to include specific database drivers and other relevant libraries based on your chosen database.
* **Deployment configuration:** Consider including instructions on how to deploy the platform to a production environment, which might involve containerization, cloud infrastructure setup, and potential configuration changes.
